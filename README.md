# MDPT - MinecraftDatapack+ Transpiler

currently is under heavy development

this project's goal is not to create a fully working transpiler

but setting the base for it and proving it would be possible to do


## Objectives

* (Priority) transform a custom file format into a minecraft comptatible datapack format

* (Priority) adding variables and function call with arguments support to datapacks

* adding methods allowing to be able to run different regularly used patterns in datapacks

* possibility to connect datapacks to each others with the use of datapack packages

## Current status

* Parser is in need of a rewrite due to a huge bug with function definition inside a function

* Compiler does it's current job, but I don't think it's currently enough for the duration of the project's development

* Tests aren't currently working
